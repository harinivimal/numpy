# About NumPy package

NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.It is a Python library used for working with arrays in an efficient manner.
Also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
This behavior is called locality of reference.
This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
